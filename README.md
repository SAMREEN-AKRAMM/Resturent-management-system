Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Webpage</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS styles go here */
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }
        .container {
            text-align: center;
            margin-top: 100px;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #333;
        }
        .my-button {
            display: inline-block;
            padding: 10px 20px;
            background-color: #007bff;
            color: #fff;
            text-decoration: none;
            border: none;
            border-radius: 5px;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
        .my-button:hover {
            background-color: #0056b3;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
        <a href="#" class="my-button">Click Me</a>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
This code creates a simple webpage with a centered heading and a button. The CSS styles define the fonts, colors, and layout for the page elements. You can further customize the styles and content according to your needs.
